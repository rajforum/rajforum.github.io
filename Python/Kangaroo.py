There are two kangaroos on an x-axis ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).
    1. The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
    2. The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
    3. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if theyâ€™ll ever land at the same location at the same time?
